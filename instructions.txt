These are the instruction for today's exercise:
First clone the following repository (git@github.com:JuanBeltranP/EXAMPLE.git).
Then, type your name and then type your favourite colour, favourite food, favourite fruit and your hometown in the CSV file called Fav.csv.
Let's do it in the best interactive way!
You are going to work in a 5-people team!
The first step is to create a personal branch.
Each member of the team is going to modify a single line of the Fav.csv file using a unique branch (each member of the team create a new branch). Please only modify from the line 3 to line 8. It is important that you define with your team which line each member is going to modify.
Then, the leader of each team is going to merge the results into a team branch. and merge the team branch with the master branch!
At the end we are going to calculate statistics about our favourite things!
