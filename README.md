# Exercise
 In this repository you are going to find the instructions of today's exercise!

## This is a Mark Down file!
### It allows you to create different subtitles
And also links, [for example this is a link](https://github.com/JuanBeltranP/EXAMPLE) to GitHub website!
You can see internal links, so you can open internal documents such as your [favourite things](Fav.csv)

#These are the instruction for today's exercise:
* First clone the following repository (git@github.com:JuanBeltranP/EXAMPLE.git)
* Then, type your name and then type your favourite colour, favourite food, favourite fruit and your hometown in the CSV file called Fav.csv
* Let's do it in the best interactive way!
* You are going to work in a 5-people team!
* The first step is to create a personal branch
* Each member of the team is going to modify a single line of the Fav.csv file using a unique branch (each member of the team create a new branch). Please only modify from the line 3 to line 8. It is important that you define with your team which line each member is going to modify.
* Then, the leader of each team is going to merge the results into a team branch. and merge the team branch with the master branch!
* At the end we are going to calculate statistics about our favourite things!
